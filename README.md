# OpenGL Rendering Engine 

An OpenGL rendering engine written in C. 
The engine is small and light. 
It implements things like shadow mapping, ambient occlusion, and shader application.
This engine is made open source through the MPL 2.0 license.

- This is a software rasterizer for OpenGL
- This does not use any existing graphics libraries

This is a proof-of-concept _and_ a learning tool for myself.

Good game development necessitates a good understanding of graphics.
